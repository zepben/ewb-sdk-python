    A dictionary of references between mRID's that as yet have not been resolved - typically when transferring services between systems.
    The key is the to_mrid of the `UnresolvedReference`s, and the value is a list of `UnresolvedReference`s for that specific object.
    For example, if an AcLineSegment with mRID 'acls1' is present in the service, but the service is missing its `location` with mRID 'location-l1'

@dataclass(slots=True)
class Traversal(Generic[T]):
    """
    Base class that provides some common functionality for traversals. This includes things like registering callbacks
    to be called at every step in the traversal as well as registering stop conditions that traversals can check for when
    to stop following a path.

    This class is asyncio compatible. Stop condition and step action callbacks are called with await.

    A stop condition is a callback function that must return a boolean indicating whether the Traversal should stop
    processing the current branch. Tracing will only stop when either:
        - All branches have been exhausted, or
        - A stop condition has returned true on every possible branch.
    Stop conditions will be called prior to applying any callbacks, but the stop will only occur after all actions
    have been applied.

    Step actions are functions to be called on each item visited in the trace. These are called after the stop conditions are evaluated, and each action is
    passed the current item, as well as the `stopping` state (True if the trace is stopping after the current item, False otherwise). Thus, the signature of
    each step action must be:
    :func: action(it: T, is_stopping: bool) -> None

    This base class does not actually provide any way to traverse the items. It needs to be implemented in
    subclasses. See `BasicTraversal` for an example.

    A Measurement represents any measured, calculated or non-measured non-calculated quantity. Any piece of equipment
    may contain Measurements, e.g. a substation may have temperature measurements and door open indications,
    a transformer may have oil temperature and tank pressure measurements, a bay may contain a number of power flow
    measurements and a Breaker may contain a switch status measurement.

    The PSR - Measurement association is intended to capture this use of Measurement and is included in the naming
    hierarchy based on EquipmentContainer. The naming hierarchy typically has Measurements as leafs,
    e.g. Substation-VoltageLevel-Bay-Switch-Measurement.

    Some Measurements represent quantities related to a particular sensor location in the network, e.g. a voltage
    transformer (PT) at a busbar or a current transformer (CT) at the bar between a breaker and an isolator. The
    sensing position is not captured in the PSR - Measurement association. Instead it is captured by the Measurement
    - Terminal association that is used to define the sensing location in the network topology. The location is
    defined by the connection of the Terminal to ConductingEquipment.

    If both a Terminal and PSR are associated, and the PSR is of type ConductingEquipment, the associated Terminal
    should belong to that ConductingEquipment instance.

    When the sensor location is needed both Measurement-PSR and Measurement-Terminal are used. The Measurement-Terminal
    association is never used alone.

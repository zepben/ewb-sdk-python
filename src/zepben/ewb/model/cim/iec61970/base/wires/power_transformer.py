class PowerTransformer(ConductingEquipment):
    """
    An electrical device consisting of  two or more coupled windings, with or without a magnetic core, for introducing
    mutual coupling between electric circuits.

    Transformers can be used to control voltage and phase shift (active power flow). A power transformer may be composed of separate transformer tanks that
    need not be identical. A power transformer can be modeled with or without tanks and is intended for use in both balanced and unbalanced representations.

    A power transformer typically has two terminals, but may have one (grounding), three or more terminals.

    The inherited association ConductingEquipment.BaseVoltage should not be used.
    The association from TransformerEnd to BaseVoltage should be used instead.

    vector_group: VectorGroup = VectorGroup.UNKNOWN
    """
    Vector group of the transformer for protective relaying, e.g., Dyn1. For unbalanced transformers, this may not be simply
    determined from the constituent winding connections and phase angle displacements.
                                                                                                                            
    The vectorGroup string consists of the following components in the order listed: high voltage winding connection, mid
    voltage winding connection(for three winding transformers), phase displacement clock number from 0 to 11,  low voltage
    winding connection phase displacement clock number from 0 to 11.   The winding connections are D(delta), Y(wye),
    YN(wye with neutral), Z(zigzag), ZN(zigzag with neutral), A(auto transformer). Upper case means the high voltage,
    lower case mid or low.The high voltage winding always has clock position 0 and is not included in the vector group
    string.  Some examples: YNy0(two winding wye to wye with no phase displacement), YNd11(two winding wye to delta with
    330 degrees phase displacement), YNyn0d5(three winding transformer wye with neutral high voltage, wye with neutral mid
    voltage and no phase displacement, delta low voltage with 150 degrees displacement).
                                                                                                                            
    Phase displacement is defined as the angular difference between the phasors representing the voltages between the
    neutral point(real or imaginary) and the corresponding terminals of two windings, a positive sequence voltage system
    being applied to the high-voltage terminals, following each other in alphabetical sequence if they are lettered, or in
    numerical sequence if they are numbered: the phasors are assumed to rotate in a counter-clockwise sense.

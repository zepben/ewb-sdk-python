:::warning
The API for consuming data from the Evolve data server is currently in alpha and very likely to experience breaking changes 
in the future. Please provide any feedback about this API to [Zepben](http://www.zepben.com).
:::

The SDK provides a client to request models to a remote data server via [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). The service and proto 
definitions for this API can be found [here](https://github.com/zepben/evolve-grpc). An implementation of the consumer 
server is provided with the Evolve platform data services.

When working with models, it is often impractical to load a whole model to a client due to the size of the data. This 
is generally not a problem however, as most use cases only operate on a small subsection of the model at a time. So, the 
consumer API provides the ability to request smaller portions of the model quickly and easily. The other benefit to this
is you can set up many clients in parallel operating on different chunks of the model to reduce the amount of time to
run any analytics you may wish to perform across the whole model.

## Connecting to a server

There are many helper functions to connect to a Energy Workbench server (EWB). All authenticated connections are based on OAuth2 flows, and
you will need to use the correct function for the configuration of the server, and for which credentials you plan to use.
This will typically be one of the following:

1. `connect_insecure()`, for unauthenticated, insecure connections. Cannot be used against a secured (HTTPS) EWB.
1. `connect_tls()`, for unauthenticated, but https connections. Can only be used if EWB is configured without auth.
1. `connect_with_password()`, for authenticating with a username, password, and client ID.
1. `connect_with_secret()`, for authenticating with a client ID and secret, typically used for machine-to-machine services.1
1. `connect_with_identity()`, for authenticating with an Azure managed identity.

All connection functions return a channel that can be used for synchronous or asynchronous (asyncio) consumer clients.

### Connecting Insecurely

```python
from zepben.evolve import connect_insecure, Feeder, SyncNetworkConsumerClient, NetworkConsumerClient

# Synchronous
channel = connect_insecure(host="localhost", rpc_port=50051)
client = SyncNetworkConsumerClient(channel)
result = client.get_equipment_container("xxx", Feeder)
# do stuff with service
client.service.get('...')

# Asyncio
async with connect_insecure(host="localhost", rpc_port=50051) as channel:
    client = NetworkConsumerClient(channel)
    result = await client.get_equipment_container("xxx", Feeder)
    # do stuff with service
    client.service.get('...')
```

### Connecting with HTTPS

To connect to a HTTPS server with no auth all that's needed is the CA for the server. If the CA is in your system certificates it should be picked up
automatically and the following should suffice:

```python
from zepben.evolve import connect_tls, SyncNetworkConsumerClient, Feeder

channel = connect_tls(host="ewb.zepben.com", rpc_port=443)
client = SyncNetworkConsumerClient(channel)
result = client.get_equipment_container("xxx", Feeder)
client.service.get('...')
```

To specify a CA bundle pass the ca parameter:
```python
from zepben.evolve import connect_tls, SyncNetworkConsumerClient, Feeder
from zepben.protobuf.nc.nc_requests_pb2 import INCLUDE_ENERGIZED_LV_FEEDERS

channel = connect_tls(host="ewb.zepben.com", rpc_port=443, ca_filename="path/to/ca/bundle")
client = SyncNetworkConsumerClient(channel)

result = client.get_equipment_container("xxx", Feeder)
# The Feeder container only contains HV/MV equipment. To include LV, use the following line instead:
result = client.get_equipment_container("xxx", Feeder, include_energized_containers=INCLUDE_ENERGIZED_LV_FEEDERS)

client.service.get('...')
```

If client authentication is required by the server, use the underlying `GrpcChannelBuilder` class instead:
```python
from zepben.evolve import GrpcChannelBuilder, SyncNetworkConsumerClient, Feeder
from zepben.protobuf.nc.nc_requests_pb2 import INCLUDE_ENERGIZED_LV_FEEDERS

channel = (
    GrpcChannelBuilder()
    .for_address("ewb.zepben.com", 443)
    .make_secure("path/to/ca/bundle", "path/to/cert/chain", "path/to/private/key")
    .build()
)
client = SyncNetworkConsumerClient(channel)

result = client.get_equipment_container("xxx", Feeder)

client.service.get('...')
```

### Authentication

Password Credentials and Client credentials OAuth2 flows are supported through the `connect_with_secret` and `connect_with_password` functions respectively:

```python
from zepben.evolve import connect_with_password, connect_with_secret, SyncNetworkConsumerClient

# Client credentials configuration
channel = connect_with_secret(client_id="some_client_id", client_secret="some_client_secret", host="ewb.zepben.com", rpc_port=443)
client = SyncNetworkConsumerClient(channel)
# ...

# Password credentials configuration
channel = connect_with_password(client_id="some_client_id", username="user@email.com", password="password1", host="ewb.zepben.com", rpc_port=443)
client = SyncNetworkConsumerClient(channel)
# ...
```

If EWB is running in Azure with Entra ID set up for auth on the EWB server, we support Azure managed identities using `connect_with_identity`:

```python
from zepben.evolve import connect_with_identity, SyncNetworkConsumerClient

# Client credentials configuration
channel = connect_with_identity(host="ewb.zepben.com", rpc_port=443, identity_url="http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=<SOME_IDENTIFIER>")
client = SyncNetworkConsumerClient(channel)
# ...
```

## Network Hierarchy

The network can be built with a hierarchy as discussed earlier [here](datamodel.mdx#network-hierarchy). This allows you
to easily identify and request smaller chunks of the network so you can focus on areas of concern. Here is an example
of how to request the network hierarchy and print it out as a tree to the console.

```python
from zepben.evolve import SyncNetworkConsumerClient

def print_network_hierarchy(client: SyncNetworkConsumerClient):
    hierarchy = client.get_network_hierarchy().result
    if not hierarchy:
        return
    for region in hierarchy.geographical_regions:
        print(f"- {region.name} [{region.mrid}]")
        for sub_region in region.sub_geographical_regions:
            print(f"  |- {sub_region.name} [{sub_region.mrid}]")
            for substation in sub_region.substations:
                print(f"    |- {sub_region.name} [{sub_region.mrid}]")
                for feeder in substation.feeders:
                    print(f"      |- {feeder.name} [{feeder.mrid}]")
```

Each item from the hierarchy result contains an identified object mRID and it's name. This simplified data structure
enables you to do things like easily build a suitable UI component allowing a user to select a portion of the network
they wish to use, without needing to pull back large amounts of full object data.

## Requesting Identified Objects

:::warning
The *ConsumerClient APIs will take care of this for you, and you typically only need these functions if you're
developing the consumer client APIs themselves. Make sure what you want to achieve isn't already covered by the
API before delving into this code.
:::

Identified objects can be requested to build a model client side. When identified objects are loaded, any referenced
objects that have not been previously requested need to be requested explicitly.

To find the references that need to be requested you can use the [deferred reference](services.mdx#deferred-references)
functions on the service provided when requesting identified objects.

```python
from zepben.evolve import NetworkService, SyncNetworkConsumerClient, resolver

def get_with_base_voltage(service: NetworkService, client: SyncNetworkConsumerClient, mrid: str):
    equipment = client.get_identified_object(mrid).result
    if not equipment:
        return

    # Get all base voltage relationships
    mrids = list(service.get_unresolved_reference_mrids_by_resolver(resolver.ce_base_voltage(equipment)))
    if mrids:
        client.get_identified_object(mrids[0])
```

You can also query the services UnresolvedReferences in the following ways:

```python
# To get unresolved references pointing from `equipment` to other objects:
for ref in service.get_unresolved_references_from(equipment.mrid):
    await client.get_identified_object(service, ref.to_mrid)

# To get unresolved references pointing to `equipment`:
for ref in service.get_unresolved_references_to(equipment.mrid):
    await client.get_identified_object(service, ref.from_ref.mrid)

# Get all unresolved references. Note this will iterate over every unresolved reference and is likely undesirable. You should prefer to use the above two methods.
for ref in service.unresolved_references():
    await client.get_identified_object(service, ref.to_mrid)
```

## Service metadata

Metadata about the servers title, version, and data sources can be retrieved via the `getMetadata()` call.

```python
service_info = client.get_metadata()
print(service_info.title)

print("Data sources:")
for ds in service_info.data_sources:
    print(f"  {ds.title}")
    print(f"  {ds.version}")
    print(f"  {ds.timestamp}")
```

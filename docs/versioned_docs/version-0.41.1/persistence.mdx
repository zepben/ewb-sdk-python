## Evolve data service

:::warning
The API for persisting data to a remote server is currently in alpha and very likely to experience breaking changes 
in the future. Please provide any feedback about this API to [Zepben](http://www.zepben.com).
:::

The SDK provides a client to send models to a remote data server via [gRPC](http://grpc.io/). The service and proto
definitions for this API can be found [here](http://github.com/zepben/evolve-grpc). An implementation of the server for
the services is provided with the Evolve platform data services.

Here is an example of how to connect to and send a model to the evolve data server:

```python
from zepben.evolve import connect_async, connect, ProducerClient, NetworkService, CustomerService, DiagramService

async with connect_async(host="localhost", rpc_port=50051) as channel:
    client = ProducerClient(channel)

    network_service = NetworkService()
    customer_service = CustomerService()
    diagram_service = DiagramService()
    populate_network_objects(network_service)

    await client.send([network_service, customer_service, diagram_service])

# Or using the synchronous API:
with connect(host="localhost", rpc_port=50051) as channel:
    client = ProducerClient(channel)

    network_service = NetworkService()
    customer_service = CustomerService()
    diagram_service = DiagramService()
    populate_network_objects(network_service)

    client.send([network_service, customer_service, diagram_service])
```

The `ProducerClient` is an abstraction layer that allows sending all services at once (useful for a server that exposes
more than one service), however typically you'll want to use a dedicated service for the data you are working with.
For these cases there are the following classes:

- `NetworkProducerClient`
- `CustomerProducerClient`
- `DiagramProducerClient`

These classes expose a similar API to `ProducerClient`, however accepting a single service of the named type rather than a list.
For example:

```python
from zepben.evolve import connect_async, NetworkService, CustomerService, DiagramService, NetworkProducerClient, CustomerProducerClient, DiagramProducerClient

async with connect_async(host="localhost", rpc_port=50051) as channel:
    network_client = NetworkProducerClient(channel)

    network_service = NetworkService()
    populate_network_objects(network_service)

    await client.send([network_service, customer_service, diagram_service])

async with connect_async(host="localhost", rpc_port=50052) as channel:
    customer_client = CustomerProducerClient(channel)

    customer_service = CustomerService()
    populate_customer_objects(customer_service)

    await client.send(customer_service)

async with connect_async(host="localhost", rpc_port=50052) as channel:
    diagram_client = DiagramProducerClient(channel)

    diagram_service = DiagramService()
    populate_diagram_objects(diagram_service)

    await client.send(diagram_service)
```

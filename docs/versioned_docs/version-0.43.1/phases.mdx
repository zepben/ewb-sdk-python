title: Phases and Feeder Directions

There are three different types of phases stored/calculated by the SDK:

| Phase Type | SDK Field                 | Field Type  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|------------|---------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Nominal    | `Terminal.phases`         | `PhaseCode` | The nominal phases of the network indicate how the network is connected. The nominal phases can include the "unknown" phases `X` and `Y`. <br/><br/>This is the phase field that you are most likely to be interested in.  |
| Normal     | `Terminal.normal_phases`  | `Traced`    | The normal phases indicate the energised phases of the network in its normal state. There will not be any unknown phases in the normal phases, however; any de-energised areas of the network will not have normal phases. |
| Current    | `Terminal.current_phases` | `Traced`    | The current phases indicate the energised phases of the network in the current state. It has the same caveats as the normal phases.                                                                                        |

There are two different feeder directions calculated by the SDK:

| Feeder Direction Type | SDK Field                           | Field Type        | Description                                                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Normal                | `Terminal.normal_feeder_direction`  | `FeederDirection` | The direction of the feeder head with the network in its normal state.  |
| Current               | `Terminal.current_feeder_direction` | `FeederDirection` | The direction of the feeder head with the network in its current state. |

## Traced Phases

Traced phases should be considered '_read-only_' (even though they have setters). The traced phases will be automatically set if you load a database from disk,
otherwise you should make use of the `SetPhases` class. If you are implementing network modification algorithms, you can also make use of the `RemovePhases`
class if required.

There are two methods for accessing the traced phases:
1. As a `PhaseCode`. If the traced phases do not form a valid phase code this will return `null`.
2. Per nominal phase.

```python
class PhaseLogger:
    @staticmethod
    def log_phases(terminal: Terminal):
        phase_code = terminal.normal_phases.as_phase_code()
        if phase_code:
            print(f"Found phases for {terminal}. nominal: {terminal.phases}, normal: {phase_code}")
        else:
            print(f"Found partial phases {terminal}:")
            for nominalPhase in terminal.phases:
                print(f"   nominal: {nominalPhase}, normal: {terminal.normal_phases[nominalPhase]}")
```

## Feeder Direction

Feeder direction can be set to one of the following values:

| Value        | Description                                                                                                               |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `UPSTREAM`   | Traversing from this terminal will lead you towards the feeder head.                                                      |
| `DOWNSTREAM` | Traversing from this terminal will lead you away from the feeder head.                                                    |
| `BOTH`       | This terminal is part of a loop and traversing from this terminal can both lead you towards or away from the feeder head. |
| `NONE`       | This terminal is not on a feeder. e.g. De-energised sections or EHV.                                                      |

_**NOTE**_: A terminal only has a single feeder direction for each state of the network, so if there is unganged switching, not all nominal phases may
trace in the direction specified. A direction of `BOTH` can be formed from some phases tracing `UPSTREAM`, with others tracing `DOWNSTREAM`.

```python
class DirectionLogger:
    @staticmethod
    def log_direction(terminal: Terminal):
        print(f"{terminal}: normal={terminal.normal_feeder_direction}, current={terminal.current_feeder_direction}")
```

## Previous Versions

Previously, traced phases and feeder directions were stored together and could only be accessed per nominal phase. Below are some examples of converting from
the old format to the current:

```Python
# Old
class PhaseAndDirectionLoggerOld:
    @staticmethod
    def log(terminal: Terminal):
        print(f"{terminal}:")
        for phase in terminal.phases.single_phases:
            nps = normal_phases(terminal, phase)
            cps = current_phases(terminal, phase)

            print(f"   {phase}: n:{nps.phase()}:{nps.direction()}, c:{cps.phase()}:{cps.direction()}")

# Becomes
class PhaseAndDirectionLoggerOld:
    @staticmethod
    def log(terminal: Terminal):
        print(f"{terminal}: dn:{terminal.normal_feeder_direction}, dc:{terminal.current_feeder_direction}")
        for phase in terminal.phases:
            print(f"   {phase}: n:{terminal.normal_phases[phase]}, c:{terminal.current_phases[phase]}")
```

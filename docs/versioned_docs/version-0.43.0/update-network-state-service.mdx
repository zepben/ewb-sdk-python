An implementation of the `UpdateNetworkStateService` will provide an object-oriented wrapper for the gRPC library, with the ability to update information about
the state of the network. This is done with the following 3 steps:

1. Create callbacks which will be called when gRPC messages are received from a client.
2. Register the callbacks with an instance of the `UpdateNetworkStateService`.
3. Add your `UpdateNetworkStateService` instance as a gRPC service.

## Creating callbacks

Each supported message in `UpdateNetworkStateService` requires a callback, which will be triggered when any client messages are received.

### on_set_current_states

The `on_set_current_states` callback is triggered for each request passing in a batch of current state events, and should return a
[batch result response](update-network-state-client.mdx#batch-result-responses) to reflect the success or failure of the update process.

```python
from typing import AsyncGenerator, Tuple

from zepben.evolve import CurrentStateEvent, SetCurrentStatesStatus


async def on_set_current_states(batches: AsyncGenerator[Tuple[int, Tuple[CurrentStateEvent, ...]], None]) -> AsyncGenerator[
    SetCurrentStatesStatus, None]:
    async for batch_id, events in batches:
        # process updating of events here and return a batch result response
```

## Registering callbacks

Registering the callbacks with the service is as simple as passing them into the `UpdateNetworkStateService` constructor.

```python
service = UpdateNetworkStateService(on_set_current_states)
```

## Registering the service

For the above code to have any effect, you need to register the service with a gRPC server. Once this has been done, you should start to receive callbacks for
each request sent from a gRPC client.

```python
import grpc
from zepben.protobuf.ns.network_state_pb2_grpc import add_UpdateNetworkStateServiceServicer_to_server

from zepben.evolve import UpdateNetworkStateService

server = grpc.aio.server()
host = 'localhost:50051'
server.add_insecure_port(host)

add_UpdateNetworkStateServiceServicer_to_server(service, server)

await server.start()
```

## Putting it all together

Putting each of the steps above together, you can build the scaffold of a working application

```python
from typing import AsyncGenerator, Tuple

import grpc
from zepben.protobuf.ns.network_state_pb2_grpc import add_UpdateNetworkStateServiceServicer_to_server

from zepben.evolve import CurrentStateEvent, SetCurrentStatesStatus, UpdateNetworkStateService, BatchSuccessful


class UpdateNetworkStateServiceImpl:
    def __init__(self):
        self.service = UpdateNetworkStateService(self.on_set_current_states)

    async def on_set_current_states(self, batches: AsyncGenerator[Tuple[int, Tuple[CurrentStateEvent, ...]], None]) -> AsyncGenerator[
        SetCurrentStatesStatus, None]:
        async for batch_id, events in batches:
            # process updating of events here and return a batch result response

async def main():
    server = grpc.aio.server()
    host = 'localhost:50051'
    server.add_insecure_port(host)

    service = UpdateNetworkStateServiceImpl().service
    add_UpdateNetworkStateServiceServicer_to_server(service, server)

    await server.start()
```

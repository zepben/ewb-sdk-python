An implementation of the `QueryNetworkStateService` will provide an object-oriented wrapper for the gRPC library, with the ability to retrieve information about
the state of the network. This is done with the following 3 steps:

1. Create callbacks which will be called when gRPC messages are received from a client.
2. Register the callbacks with an instance of the `QueryNetworkStateService`.
3. Add your `QueryNetworkStateService` instance as a gRPC service.

## Creating callbacks

Each supported message in `QueryNetworkStateService` requires a callback, which will be triggered when any client messages are received.

### on_get_current_states

The `on_get_current_states` callback is triggered for each request for the current states between two date/times, and should return an async iterator of the
current state events that occurred between those date/times (inclusive)

```python
from datetime import datetime
from typing import AsyncGenerator, Iterable

from zepben.ewb import CurrentStateEventBatch


async def on_get_current_states(from_datetime: datetime, to_datetime: datetime) -> AsyncGenerator[CurrentStateEventBatch, None]:
    events = []
    # build the batch of events
    yield events
```

### onCurrentStatesStatus

The `onCurrentStatesStatus` callback is triggered for each status response sent by the client. You should expect to receive one of these for every batch
returned from `onGetCurrentStates`.

```python
from zepben.ewb import SetCurrentStatesStatus


def on_current_states_status(event_status: SetCurrentStatesStatus):
    # Do something with the `eventStatus`.
```

### onProcessingError

The `onProcessingError` callback is triggered for any errors in your `onCurrentStatesStatus` callback, or if any [SetCurrentStatesResponse] is for an unknown
event status.

```python
def on_processing_error(error: Exception):
    # Do something with the `error`.
```

## Registering callbacks

Registering the callbacks with the service is as simple as passing them into the `QueryNetworkStateService` constructor.

```python
service = QueryNetworkStateService(on_get_current_states, on_current_states_status, on_processing_error)
```

## Registering the service

For the above code to have any effect, you need to register the service with a gRPC server. Once this has been done, you should start to receive callbacks for
each request sent from a gRPC client.

```python
import grpc
from zepben.protobuf.ns.network_state_pb2_grpc import add_QueryNetworkStateServiceServicer_to_server


server = grpc.aio.server()
host = 'localhost:50051'
server.add_insecure_port(host)

add_QueryNetworkStateServiceServicer_to_server(service, server)

await server.start()
```

## Putting it all together

Putting each of the steps above together, you can build the scaffold of a working application

```python
from datetime import datetime
from typing import AsyncGenerator, Iterable

import grpc
from zepben.protobuf.ns.network_state_pb2_grpc import add_QueryNetworkStateServiceServicer_to_server

from zepben.ewb import CurrentStateEventBatch, QueryNetworkStateService, SetCurrentStatesStatus

class QueryNetworkStateServiceImpl:

    def __init__(self):
        self.service = QueryNetworkStateService(self.on_get_current_states, self.on_current_states_status, self.on_processing_error)

    async def on_get_current_states(self, from_datetime: datetime, to_datetime: datetime) -> AsyncGenerator[CurrentStateEventBatch, None]:
        events = []
        # build the batch of events
        yield events

    def on_current_states_status(event_status: SetCurrentStatesStatus):
        # Do something with the `eventStatus`.

    def on_processing_error(error: Exception):
        # Do something with the `error`.

async def main():
    server = grpc.aio.server()
    host = 'localhost:50051'
    server.add_insecure_port(host)

    service = QueryNetworkStateServiceImpl().service
    add_QueryNetworkStateServiceServicer_to_server(service, server)

    await server.start()
```

The `QueryNetworkStateClient` will allow you to interact with a server running the `QueryNetworkStateService`. It provides an object-oriented
wrapper for the gRPC library, with the ability to retrieve information about the state of the network. This is done with the following 3 steps:

1. Create a gRPC connection to the server.
1. Create an instance of the `QueryNetworkStateClient` using your gRPC connection.
2. Use your `QueryNetworkStateClient` to retrieve the state of the network.

## Creating a gRPC channel

The channel gRPC channel can be directly from the gPRC libray, or using our `GrpcChannelBuilder` helper. At its most basic, this can be achieved with:

```python
from zepben.evolve import GrpcChannelBuilder

channel = GrpcChannelBuilder().for_address(host, port).build()
```

For more in depth options for using a gRPC channel, see the [gRPC documentation](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/), or look up a tutorial.

## Using a gRPC channel with your client

Using your gRPC channel with the `QueryNetworkStateClient` is as simple as passing it to the constructor.

```python
from zepben.evolve import QueryNetworkStateClient

client = QueryNetworkStateClient(channel)
```

## Using your client to query the network state

Now that you have a client, you can use it to query the state of the network on the connected server.

### Querying current network state

The current state of the network between two date/times can be retrieved using the `get_current_states` function on the `QueryNetworkStateClient`.


```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

async for events in client.get_current_states(1, datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1), datetime.now()):
    # process the list of events here.
```

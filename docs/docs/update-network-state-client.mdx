The `UpdateNetworkStateClient` will allow you to interact with a server running the `UpdateNetworkStateService` (e.g. EWB). It provides an object-oriented
wrapper for the gRPC library, with the ability to update information about the state of the network. This is done with the following 3 steps:

1. Create a gRPC connection to the server.
1. Create an instance of the `UpdateNetworkStateClient` using your gRPC connection.
2. Use your `UpdateNetworkStateClient` to update the state of the network.

## Creating a gRPC channel

The channel gRPC channel can be directly from the gRPC library, or using our `GrpcChannelBuilder` helper. At its most basic, this can be achieved with:

```python
from zepben.evolve import GrpcChannelBuilder

channel = GrpcChannelBuilder().for_address(host, port).build()
```

For more in depth options for using a gRPC channel, see the [gRPC documentation](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/), or look up a tutorial.

## Using a gRPC channel with your client

Using your gRPC channel with the `UpdateNetworkStateClient` is as simple as passing it to the constructor.

```python
from zepben.evolve import UpdateNetworkStateClient

client = UpdateNetworkStateClient(channel)
```

## Using your client to update the network state

Now that you have a client, you can use it to update the state of the network on the connected server.

### Updating current network state

The current state of the network can be updated using the `set_current_states` function on the `UpdateNetworkStateClient`. All events passed in the same list will
be executed as a batch.

#### Updating current switch state

The current state of switches can be updating by passing a `SwitchStateEvent` to the `set_current_states` function.

```python
from datetime import datetime

from zepben.evolve import SwitchStateEvent, SwitchAction

event1 = SwitchStateEvent("event1", datetime.now(), "switch_id_1", SwitchAction.OPEN)
event2 = SwitchStateEvent("event2", datetime.now(), "switch_id_2", SwitchAction.CLOSE)
response = client.set_current_states(1, (event1, event2))
```

#### Adding cuts

You can cut an AcLineSegment in the current state of the network by passing an `AddCutEvent` to the `set_current_states` function.

```python
from datetime import datetime

from zepben.evolve import AddCutEvent

event1 = AddCutEvent("event1", datetime.now(), "cut_id", "acls_id")
response = client.set_current_states(1, (event1))
```

#### Removing cuts

You can remove a previously added cut from the current state of the network by passing a `RemoveCutEvent` to the `set_current_states` function.

```python
from datetime import datetime

from zepben.evolve import RemoveCutEvent

event1 = RemoveCutEvent("event1", datetime.now(), "cut_id")
response = client.set_current_states(1, (event1))
```

#### Adding jumpers

You can add a jumper between two other pieces of equipment in the current state of the network by passing an `AddJumperEvent` to the `set_current_states` function.

```python
from datetime import datetime

from zepben.evolve import AddJumperEvent, JumperConnection

event1 = AddJumperEvent("event1", datetime.now(), "jumper_id", JumperConnection("from_id", JumperConnection("to_id")))
response = client.set_current_states(1, (event1))
```

#### Removing jumpers

You can remove a previously added jumper from the current state of the network by passing a `RemoveJumperEvent` to the `set_current_states` function.

```python
from datetime import datetime

from zepben.evolve import RemoveJumperEvent

event1 = RemoveJumperEvent("event1", datetime.now(), "jumper_id")
response = client.set_current_states(1, (event1))
```

#### Multiple Requests

If you have multiple batches to send, you can use `set_current_states_in_batches` rather than calling `set_current_states` multiple times

```python
from datetime import datetime

from zepben.evolve import SwitchStateEvent, SwitchAction

event1 = SwitchStateEvent("event1", datetime.now(), "switch_id_1", SwitchAction.OPEN)
event2 = SwitchStateEvent("event2", datetime.now(), "switch_id_2", SwitchAction.CLOSE)

async def events_in_batches():
    yield UpdateNetworkStateClient.SetCurrentStatesRequest(1, (event1,))
    yield UpdateNetworkStateClient.SetCurrentStatesRequest(2, (event2,))

async for response in client.set_current_states_in_batches(events_in_batches()):
    # Process your responses here. You will get a response per batch.
```

### Batch result responses

Each batch will receive its own response, which will be one of the following:
* `BatchSuccessful` - Indicates that all events in the batch were processed successfully. Events that are ignored because they set the state to one that is
  already present, or are skipped due to a later event applying the opposite action, will be marked as successful.
* `ProcessingPaused` - Indicates the entire batch was ignore as current state processing in teh server is currently paused. The response will include the time
  the server was paused.
* `BatchFailure` - Indicates at least one event in the batch could not be applied. Each event that failed will indicate why it failed, some of which will have
  more impact than others.
  * `StateEventUnknownMrid` - The `mRID` of the event could not be found in the network hosted by this server.
  * `StateEventDuplicateMrid` - The `mRID` of an item being added to the network is already in use.
  * `StateEventInvalidMrid` - The `mRID` of the item being addressed in the event is of a different type than expected. e.g. You can't remove a `Jumper` with an
    `mRID` that belongs to a `Cut`.
  * `StateEventUnsupportedPhasing` - You tried to specify phases that do not make sense to the item being updated. When using the default phasing of `NONE` you
    will never receive this error. Until un-ganged switching is supported, this error will be returned for all events that specify phases.

You can check the type of response or failure by checking against the types above.
```python
from zepben.evolve import BatchFailure, StateEventUnknownMrid

if isinstance(response, BatchFailure):
    response.partial_failure # Will be true if all event failed, otherwise false.
    for failure in response.failures:
        if isinstance(failure, StateEventUnknownMrid):
            # Process failure
```

Now that you are able to create a data model, you need something to manage the objects.
This is where we provide a set of classes, which we call services, to do this.

The services basically act as a container for your model. However, they provide some features which make it much nicer
to use than a typical map / dictionary type data container to store your identified objects. The SDK provides the
following services

* NetworkService
* CustomerService
* DiagramService

Each of these services manage a specific subset of identified objects. This subset will hopefully be somewhat obvious
based on the name of each service. If you would like to know why there a multiple services for different object types
you can read more about it [here](#why-multiple-services).

## Common Service functionality

Because services work with [identified objects](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/cim100/TC57CIM/IEC61970/Base/Core/IdentifiedObject)
they can provide some common level of functionality. This functionality can be found in the base class `BaseService`.

### Adding and Removing Objects

The `BaseService.add` method can be used to add objects to the service. For each service type there is a set of supported classes,
and thus `add` will only work for these types. Note that in some cases where objects are indexed differently other `add` style methods
will be present, which should be utilised to allow efficient querying of the types they support. (e.g add_diagram_object in DiagramService)

```python
from zepben.evolve import NetworkService, Breaker, Junction, IdentifiedObject
service = NetworkService()

breaker = Breaker()
service.add(breaker)

# Note you can only add types that are intended for the corresponding service, for example, the following will fail on add:
diagram = Diagram()
service.add(diagram)  # throws exception.
```

### Object Retrieval

There are a few ways we provide to get objects back out of a service. The most obvious one is by mRID:

```python
from zepben.evolve import NetworkService, Breaker

service = NetworkService()
service.add(Breaker("breaker1"))
breaker = service.get("breaker1")

# Qualifying the type yields a minor performance optimisation.
breaker = service.get("breaker1", Breaker)
```

Implementations of `BaseService` may have more dedicated methods which support more forms of retrieval.

You can also get collections of objects back out of the service. The power here is you can get objects from anywhere
in the CIM class hierarchy. Due to the internal data structures used by the services, using these functions is more
efficient than looping over all objects in the service and checking if they are of the required type.

```python
from zepben.evolve import NetworkService, Breaker, Junction, ConductingEquipment

service = NetworkService()

service.add(Breaker())
service.add(Junction())

# service.objects() can be used to get a generator over the objects in the service, and supports selecting by type.
for obj in service.objects():  # generator over all objects in service
    # do stuff with obj

for obj in service.objects(ConductingEquipment):  # generator over all objects in service subclassing ConductingEquipment
    # do stuff with obj

for obj in service.objects(Breaker):  # generator over all objects in service of type Breaker (in this case the one Breaker we added)
    obj.set_open(True)

```

## Network Service

The network service works with objects related to the physical asset model. That means all
[PowerSystemResource](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/evolve/IEC61970/Base/Core/PowerSystemResource) types, but also
data related types such as [AssetInfo](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/evolve/IEC61968/Assets/AssetInfo) and
[Location](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/evolve/IEC61968/Common/Location).

The network service also generates an index between power system resources and terminals and their corresponding
measurements. When you add a [Measurement](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/evolve/IEC61970/Base/Meas/Measurement)
to the service, it indexes it against the `power_system_resource_mrid` or the `terminal_mrid` associated with the measurement.
You can then get all measurements associated with a power system resource or a terminal via its mRID via the lookup on
the service:

```python
from zepben.evolve import NetworkService, Analog, Accumulator, Measurement

service = NetworkService()

amps = Analog(power_system_resource_mrid="ASWITCH")
count = Accumulator(power_system_resource_mrid="ASWITCH")

service.add(amps)
service.add(count)

# Gets both the analog and the accumulator
service.get_measurements("ASWITCH", Measurement)

# Will get just the analog
service.get_measurements("ASWITCH", Analog)
```

Note if you change the `power_system_resource_mrid` or `terminal_mrid` set on the measurement after it has been added to the
service, it is not re-indexed automatically. Currently you need to to remove the measurement and re-add it to the service.
However this should rarely be an issue as a measurement is unlikely to ever change the device it is measuring, so as long
as the association is set before adding to the service it is unlikely to be a problem.

## Customer Service

The customer service works with objects related to customers and their agreements they may have with actors in the
network. At this point in time it provides no further specialised functionality.

## Diagram Service

The diagram service works with objects related to diagrams associated with identified objects.
It also provides a lookup to be able to get the [DiagramObjects](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/evolve/IEC61970/Base/DiagramLayout/DiagramObject) associated with any
identified object. Specifically:
- If the mRID is a diagram object, a list with just the diagram object is returned.
- If the mRID is a [Diagram](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/evolve/IEC61970/Base/DiagramLayout/Diagram) all diagram
  objects belonging to that diagram are returned.
- If the mRID is any other identified object, the diagram objects for that identified object are returned.

```python
from zepben.evolve import DiagramService, Diagram, DiagramObject

service = DiagramService()

a_diagram = Diagram()

do1 = DiagramObject(diagram=a_diagram, identified_object_mrid="aSwitch", a_diagram.add_diagram_object(this))

do2 = DiagramObject(diagram=a_diagram, identified_object_mrid="aSwitch", a_diagram.add_diagram_object(this))

do3 = DiagramObject(diagram=a_diagram, identified_object_mrid="aSwitch", a_diagram.add_diagram_object(this))

service.add(do1)
service.add(do2)
service.add(do3)

# Contains [do1]
objs = service.get_diagram_objects(do1.mrid)

# Contains [do1, do2, do3]
objs = service.get_diagram_objects(a_diagram.mrid)

# Contains [do1, do2]
objs = service.get_diagram_objects("aSwitch")
```

This works by indexing the `identified_object_mrid` when the diagram object is added to the service. Note however,
that setting the `identified_object_mrid` after the diagram object is added will not cause it to be re-indexed automatically.
Currently you need to to remove the diagram object and re-add it to the service.
This should rarely be an issue however, as a diagram object is unlikely to ever change the identified object it is
representing, so as long as it is set before adding it to the service it is unlikely to be a problem.

## Deferred References

When creating an object to include in the model, you will often not have all referenced objects constructed, not have
all the information to construct a reference immediately, or not have a reference handy to use. However, you will 
generally have the mRID of any referenced objects. To deal with this, the services provide a `resolve_or_defer_reference`
function. This function will:
- Resolve a reference immediately (in both direcitons if applicable) if the reference mRID object is already added to the service. 
- If the reference mRID is not added to the service, the request to resolve the reference is cached. When an object 
  with the referenced mRID is eventually added to the service, the reference is resolved at this time. 

Unresolved references can also be queried back out of the service. Let's see it all with a simple example:

```python
from zepben.evolve import NetworkService, Feeder, Breaker, resolver

service = NetworkService()

feeder = Feeder("f")
service.add(feeder)

switch = Breaker("b1")
service.add(switch)

# As the switch is already added to the service, this will be resolved immediately.
service.resolve_or_defer_reference(resolver.ec_equipment(feeder), switch.mrid)
print(feeder.equipment.contains(switch)) # true

# Now if we try and resolve something not added it will be deferred
junction = Junction("j1")
service.resolve_or_defer_reference(resolver.ec_equipment(feeder), junction.mrid)
print(feeder.equipment.contains(junction)) # false

# We can query the unresolved reference MRIDs back out of the service using a specific resolver
print(service.get_unresolved_reference_mrids_by_resolver(resolver.ec_equipment(feeder))) # ["j1"]
# Or using the mrid of the destination object
print(service.get_unresolved_reference_mrids_to(feeder.mrid)) # ["j1"]
# Or using the mrid of the source object
print(service.get_unresolved_reference_mrids_from(junction.mrid)) # ["f"]

# Or simply loop over all the unresolved references
for ur in service.unresolved_references():
    print(f"From: {ur.resolver.from_class} {ur.from_mrid}, To: {ur.resolver.to_class} {ur.to_mrid}")

# Or only their mRIDs (useful for using with a consumer client)
for mrid in service.unresolved_mrids():
    print(mrid)

# When the object with the deferred mRID is added, the reference gets resolved
service.add(junction)
print(feeder.equipment.contains(junction)) # true
```

#### Why multiple services?

You might be asking "Why not just one service for all identified objects?". Admittedly, just having one would be easier
to work with. However, as models can become large, having every object in a single service (and thus process) will mean
you need an ever increasing amount of RAM in your system. What we have done is separated out parts of the
data model into separate concerns, at what we feel are sensible boundary points. That is:

* The network service deals with models of the physical electricity network.
* The customer service deals with customers and their agreements with electricity providers
(e.g their [Tariff](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/evolve/IEC61968/Customers/Tariff)).
* The diagram service deals with things related to representing networks as diagrams
(see [Diagram](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/evolve/IEC61970/Base/DiagramLayout/Diagram) and
 [DiagramObject](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/cim/evolve/IEC61970/Base/DiagramLayout/DiagramObject)).
* Once the platform supports measurement values, these values will be retrieved via a separate service rather than
  directly from measurement objects.

Ultimately there is a tradeoff between developer usability and model size feasibility. Hopefully you will find this
is a reasonable trade off when working with large systems.
